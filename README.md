# Blog proyect



Task:
Create a micro-CMS system for a personal use blog using React JS and local storage.

- Keep it really simple, don't over-engineer it
- Follow Atomic design to create the components and pages.
- Provide the atomic design organization of the site.
- No sign-in or sign-up actions are required.
- No resources such as images or video uploads are required. This is a simple test, just use a CDN of your choice or copy the image’s URL from somewhere else.
- Videos? Youtube, of course
- Text content? Loren ipsum https://www.lipsum.com/
- Please consider including tests in your code.

Develop the following required pages and React JS components for the blog:

1. Blog’s logo: A Simple component to render the blog's logo.
2. Main menu: A list of the site sections.
    - Home
    - About
    - Blog
3. Contact: Simply render contact information.
4. Image hero component: Image component to render the site's hero image.
5. Search bar: Searches the list of posts by name and returns a list of the post-matching strings entered. It should be an Auto-complete component. When clicking on one element the corresponding blog post gets loaded on the page.
6. Post-creation/edition component: No WYSIWYG required, simple HTML post formatted is ok.
7. Post-reading view page: Page to visualize the post's content.
8. Post creation page: Form enter/edit post-HTML content.
9. Posts list: Page to visualize all of the blog posts. Also, include a “add post” button here.
